BananaModManager is a fork of [MonkeModManager](https://github.com/deadlykitten/monkemodmanager) that will install and update Capuchin mods for you.

The manager currently supports both Capuchin-compatable mod loaders:
* [BepInEx](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx) by **The BepInEx Team**
* [MelonLoader](https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader) by **LavaGang**

BananaModManager will automatically check for the latest version from the internet to ensure that you will receive the latest version of all of the mods listed.

If you want a mod added to the installer, message one of us on discord (`thelinuxtrans` `stickmaster10`)
If you previously built mods for Gorilla Tag, [this guide](https://github.com/xzcowman/capuchin-bepinex-6-and-you) will help you migrate to Capuchin's mod loader, BepInEx 6.
