BananaModManager is a fork of [MonkeModManager](https://github.com/deadlykitten/monkemodmanager) that will install and update Capuchin mods for you.

The manager currently supports [MelonLoader](https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader) by **LavaGang**.

BananaModManager will automatically check for the latest version from the internet to ensure that you will receive the latest version of all of the mods listed.

If you want a mod added to the installer, message one of us on discord (`thelinuxtrans` `developerpixel`)
